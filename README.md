This is a [napari] plugin that visually exposes the functionality of napari's handling of layer metadata by directly connecting with the public API of napari layers.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is in active development. *You should not depend on any API, as it is likely to change*. Instead, understand that this plugin intends to serve as a GUI to manage already available public API of napari layers.
> If you find a feature of this plugin useful, but it is not available in napari's core API, please consider opening an issue here or in the [napari repository](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/new/choose).
